# Informal Definitions

Object (general)
:   location in memory with a value of a specific type, (usually) referenced by a named identifier

Type
:   a classification of data used to communicate the intention of its usage towards the compiler

Class
:   specifies a type of objects with their data members and operations (methods) that transfer
    these objects from one well-defined state to another

Instance / Class Object / Object (OOCP)
:   an object is called an instance of a class if it has been created by a constructor of
    the class


# Object Oriented Programming: Simplified Models

## Functional Style: State is passed between functions

$$
   method: Type \rightarrow \dots parameters \dots \rightarrow Type
$$

Which is equivalent to a C signature like:

~~~c
Type * method(const Type * obj, ... parameters ...);
// state of obj is not changed by operation, mofidied state is
// returned as new object
~~~

For example:

~~~c
Collection * collection__add_elem(Collection * c, const Element * e);

Collection * c = collection__add(
                   collection_add(collection__new(), 123),
                   456);
~~~

## Imperative Style: State is persisted in objects

~~~c
void method(Type * obj, ... parameters ...);
// state of obj is altered after operation
~~~

For example:

~~~c
void collection__add_elem(Collection * c, const Element * e);

Collection * c = collection__new();
collection__add_elem(c, 123);
collection__add_elem(c, 456);
~~~


Both functional and imperative style illustrated above are object-oriented, they
just differ in the representation of "state".


# Object-Oriented C

## Members and Methods

In C, we can use structs to represent a type as a well-defined organization
of data: 

~~~c
typedef struct {
  unsigned char r;
  unsigned char g;
  unsigned char b;
} RGB;

typedef struct {
  unsigned int x;
  unsigned int y;
  RGB;
} Pixel;

typedef struct {
  Pixel line_points[100];
} DrawLine;
~~~

**Q: This shows has-a relationships (containment) in the OO sense. \
     How could we express is-a dependencies?**

The object-oriented paradigm implies that types may be specified to follow the
Liskov substitution principle: specialized types must be semantically able to
act as any of their base types.

More precisely, how could we achieve this to work:

~~~c
Motorboat * m = motorboat__new();
Astrovan  * a = astrovan__new();

motorboat_max_passengers = vehicle__max_passengers(m);
astrovan_max_passengers  = vehicle__max_passengers(a);
~~~

In format terms, a substitution ($b \implies B) / (s \implies S:B$) of an
instance $b$ with supertype $B$ and subtype $S$ is subject to the constraints:

- Preconditions of $B$ cannot be strengthened in a subtype
- Postconditions of $B$ cannot be weakened in a subtype
- Invariants of $B$ are preserved in $S$

**However**, you will soon be convinced that inheritance is far less important
for sound concept definitions than you might have been told so far
(see *Composition over Inheritance*).


## States and Side-effects

The notion of *side-effects* is common in the functional programming mind set.
In the conventional mathematical interpretation of the function concept, a
function call is a *static* mapping between value spaces. As a consequence
in functional programming, any function call could be replaced by its result.
Functions that satisfy this property named **referential transparency**
are called **pure**.

Any persistent, observable effect of a function call would violate referential
transparency. For example, calls of `printf` could not be replaced by their
returned result (usually 0) as this would eliminate the intended side-effect
on the console.

Unfortunately, every operation on a physical computational machine does have
side-effects. At the very least, the CPU instruction counter is changed.
Functional programming languages like Haskell therefore classify some
side-effects as negligible.

Typically, a functional programming runtime environment aims at hiding
side-effects from the programmer by means of mechanisms like garbage collection.
Allocating data on the heap is definitely a side-effect, but considered
irrelevant to functional semantics.



~~~c
typedef struct {
  size_t   _count;
  double * _values;
} Vector;

Vector * vector__new    ();

void     vector__push   (Vector * _this, double value);
double   vector__pop    (Vector * _this);
double   vector__at     (Vector * _this, int index);
unsigned vector__size   (Vector * _this);
double   vector__sum    (Vector * _this);
~~~

Now consider:

~~~c
double dummy() {
  Vector * vectors[10];
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    Vector * v = vector__new();
    vector__push_back(v, i * 123);
    vectors[i] = v;
  }
  // ...
  return 123;
}
~~~

What's the problem with this function?

### Value Semantics and the (classical) Rule of Three

Class objects that maintain ownership of a resource need special definitions
in their behaviour. The crucial aspects are:

- Taking ownership
- Sharing ownership
- Releasing ownership
- Transferring ownership

... of a resource. In our `Vector` example, we need to define the additional
methods:

~~~c
void     vector__copy   (Vector * other);
void     vector__delete (Vector * _this);
Vector * vector__assign (Vector * _this, Vector * other);
~~~

## Standard Object Semantics

**Allocation**
  : reserves memory for an object

**Initialization**
: writes initial values to instance members in previously allocated memory

**Construction, Instantiation**
: allocation and initialization; construction is a public operation, allocation and
  initialization should not be directly accessible as separate operations

**Copy**
: special case of construction / instantiation where instance members are initialized
  with another object's state instead of default values

**Assignment**
: operation performed at a left-hand side (lhs) object such that its state is updated
  to a right-hand side (rhs) object; after assignment, equality comparison of lhs and rhs
  must return true.

**Destruction**
: Free instance members and release resources
