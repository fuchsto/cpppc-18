# Semi-formal Definitions

Object (general)
:   location in memory with a value of a specific type, (usually) referenced by a named identifier

Type
:   a classification of data used to communicate the intention of its usage towards the compiler

Class (mathematical)
:   A collection that is defined based on common properties of its elements.

Class (technical)
:   specifies a type of objects with their data members and operations (methods) 
    that transfer these objects from one valid state to another

Instance / Class Object / Object (OOCP)
:   in this course, we use the term *instance* for an object if its type is a
    class (structured), *class object* is a synonym that emphasizes the
    class-based mechanisms of an instance

**Q: What is the purpose of formal definitions? How are mathematical definitions
     and the skill to interpret them related to software engineering?**


# Object Oriented Programming: Simplified Models

## Functional Style: State is passed between functions

$$
   method: Type \rightarrow \dots parameters \dots \rightarrow Type
$$

Which is equivalent to a C signature like:

~~~c
Type * method(const Type * obj, ... parameters ...);
// state of obj is not changed by operation, mofidied state is
// returned as new object
~~~

For example:

~~~c
Collection * collection__add_elem(const Collection * c, const Element * e);

Collection * c = collection__add(
                   collection_add(collection__new(), 123),
                   456);
~~~

## Imperative Style: State is persisted in objects

~~~c
void method(Type * obj, ... parameters ...);
// state of obj is altered after operation
~~~

For example:

~~~c
void collection__add_elem(Collection * c, const Element * e);

Collection * c = collection__new();
collection__add_elem(c, 123);
collection__add_elem(c, 456);
~~~


Both functional and imperative style illustrated above are object-oriented, they
just differ in the representation of "state".

Likewise, both notations are **procedural** as the operations in either variant
take effect in the order they have been stated.


# Object-Oriented C

## Members and Methods

In C, we can use structs to represent a type as a sequential arrangement of data
in memory: 

~~~c
typedef struct {
  unsigned char r;
  unsigned char g;
  unsigned char b;
} RGB;

typedef struct {
  unsigned int x;
  unsigned int y;
  RGB;
} Pixel;

typedef struct {
  Pixel line_points[100];
} DrawLine;
~~~

**Q: This shows has-a relationships (containment) in the OO sense. \
     How could we express is-a dependencies?**

The object-oriented paradigm implies that types may be specified to follow the
Liskov substitution principle: specialized types must be semantically able to
act as any of their base types.

More precisely, how could we achieve this to work:

~~~c
Motorboat * m = motorboat__new();
Astrovan  * a = astrovan__new();

motorboat_max_passengers = vehicle__max_passengers(m);
astrovan_max_passengers  = vehicle__max_passengers(a);
~~~

In format terms, a substitution ($b \implies B) / (s \implies S:B$) of an
instance $b$ with supertype $B$ and subtype $S$ is subject to the constraints:

- Preconditions of $B$ cannot be strengthened in a subtype
- Postconditions of $B$ cannot be weakened in a subtype
- Invariants of $B$ are preserved in $S$

**However**, you will soon be convinced that inheritance is far less important
for sound concept definitions than you might have been told so far
(see *Composition over Inheritance*).


## States and Side-effects

The notion of *side-effects* is common in the functional programming mind set.
In the conventional mathematical interpretation of the function concept, a
function call is a *static* mapping between value spaces. As a consequence
in functional programming, any function call could be replaced by its result.
Functions that satisfy this property named **referential transparency**
are called **pure**.

Any persistent, observable effect of a function call would violate referential
transparency. For example, calls of `printf` could not be replaced by their
returned result (usually 0) as this would eliminate the intended side-effect
on the console.

Unfortunately, every operation on a physical computational machine does have
side-effects. At the very least, the CPU instruction counter is changed.
Functional programming languages like Haskell therefore classify some
side-effects as negligible.

Typically, a functional programming runtime environment aims at hiding
side-effects from the programmer by means of mechanisms like garbage collection.
Allocating data on the heap is definitely a side-effect, but considered
irrelevant to functional semantics.



~~~c
typedef struct {
  size_t   _count;
  double * _values;
} Vector;

Vector * vector__new    ();

void     vector__push   (Vector * _this, double value);
double   vector__pop    (Vector * _this);
double   vector__at     (Vector * _this, int index);
unsigned vector__size   (Vector * _this);
double   vector__sum    (Vector * _this);
~~~

Now consider:

~~~c
double dummy() {
  Vector * vectors[10];
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    Vector * v = vector__new();
    vector__push_back(v, i * 123);
    vectors[i] = v;
  }
  // ...
  return 123;
}
~~~

What's the problem with this function?

### Value Semantics and the (classical) Rule of Three

Class objects that maintain ownership of a resource need special definitions
in their behaviour. The crucial aspects are:

- Taking ownership
- Sharing ownership
- Releasing ownership
- Transferring ownership

... of a resource.

Transferring ownership consists of coordinated sharing and releasing ownership.
But especially in multi-threaded situations it is more complex than doing one
after the other.

In our `Vector` example, we need to define the additional methods:

~~~c
void     vector__copy   (Vector * other);
void     vector__delete (Vector * _this);
Vector * vector__assign (Vector * _this, Vector * other);
~~~

## Standard Object Semantics

**Allocation**
  : reserves memory for an object

**Initialization**
: writes initial values to instance members in previously allocated memory

**Construction, Instantiation**
: allocation and initialization; construction is a public operation, allocation and
  initialization should not be directly accessible as separate operations

**Copy**
: special case of construction / instantiation where instance members are initialized
  with another object's state instead of default values

**Assignment**
: operation performed at a left-hand side (lhs) object such that its state is updated
  to a right-hand side (rhs) object; after assignment, equality comparison of lhs and rhs
  must return true.

**Destruction**
: Free instance members and release resources

\
We discussed *Function* vs. *Method* already. A closer look at *Operator* vs. *Operation* is highly revealing as well.

Let's have a look at their definitions at Wikipedia and see if we agree:

Operator (mathematical)
: A mapping that acts on elements of a space and produces elements of the
  same space. [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics))

Do you see the implications?

Note how the choice of words in this definition sounds suspiciously uncommon.
This is because it carefully tries to avoids assumptions on how an operator
could actually work.

- Why does it say "produce elements" instead of "map to elements"?
- Why "space" instead of "set"?
- Why "act on elements" instead of "map elements from"?

Différance!
(Jacques Derrida: the *difference* of words hidden in their "deference" in a given context)


Operation (mathematical)
: A calculation from zero or more input values (operands) to an output value
  [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics))

The choice of words is very specific here: "value", "calculation", "input" ...

- **Q: Doesn't this sound notably familiar? How is this different from a function?**

Note that in Mathematics, an *Operator* is just a symbol that denotes a specific
*Operation*. Like we use the name of a function (its declaration) to represent its implementation (the function definition).
They essentially have the same meaning.

What do we learn for C++ from this?

- Operators in mathematics are essentially functions with closure
   ($X \dots \mapsto X$).
- Operators in programming languages are the same as operators in mathematics,
   plus syntactic sugar.
- Any function with signature `X fun(X, ...)` could be called "operator"
- Finally, any method in C++ `X fun(...)` defined in class `X` could be called
  "operator"

Right?

To confuse the Russians, there are
[accepted definitions of *Operator*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/operator) that 
explicitly do not imply closure.


# Mas sabe el diablo por viejo que por diablo.

When learning to play the piano, there is a specific challenge for adult
learners. As adults, we are mentally capable to fully understand concepts and
mechanisms before we achieve the competence to apply them correctly.
It is not a challenge to understand the principle of a C major chord
progression. But it will take weeks of daily exercise to transfer this
knowledge to muscle memory and making a technique second nature.

Likewise, there is mental muscle memory for modeling and programming.
Take course assignments seriously even if the related concepts seem painfully
evident.
