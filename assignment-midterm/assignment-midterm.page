# 1. Types, Classes, Objects and their State

## 1.1 Object Definition

Assuming you are confronted with a class that supports the following
use case:

```c++
DateParser date_parser;
date_parser.set_date(today);

auto day = date_parser.day_of_week();
```

What is your objection to this? How would you change the interface of class
`DateParser`?


## 1.2 Standard Object Semantics

Given the following implementation of class `SemanticSurprise`:

```c++
class SemanticSurprise {
public:

  SemanticSurprise(int value)
  : _value(value) { }

  SemanticSurprise(const SemanticSurprise & other)
  : _value(other._value) { }

  bool operator==(const SemanticSurprise & other) const {
    return _value == other._value;
  }

  int value() {
    return _value;
  }

private:
  int _value;
};
```

- Are there compiler errors? If so: why?
- Name the method/operation on `SemanticSurprise` in every line marked with
  `Op?`, including those that lead to compiler errors.
- Which values are returned in the lines marked with `value?` (given the line
  does not lead to a compiler error).
  Explain why these values are returned.
- How can this implementation be simplified? What is the requirement for
  this simplification?

```c++
SemanticSurprise s1;          // <-- Op?
s1.value();                   // <-- value?

SemanticSurprise s2(4);       // <-- Op?
s2.value();                   // <-- value?

SemanticSurprise s3 = s2;     // <-- Op?
s3.value();                   // <-- value?

SemanticSurprise s4(s3);      // <-- Op?
s4 == s3;                     // <-- value?
s2 != s3;                     // <-- value?
```

Given the implementation of `SemanticSurprise` above, the following use
case leads to a compiler error:

```c++
void print_surprise(const SemanticSurprise & s) {
  std::cout << "SemanticSurprise.value: " << s.value() << std::endl;
}

print_surprise(SemanticSurprise(10));
```

- Explain the compiler error and how the implementation of `SemanticSurprise`
  has to be corrected.


## 1.3 Resource Ownership

Consider the following use case:

```c++
// ...
if (condition) {
        LogFileReader log_reader("performance.log");
        if (log_reader.lines().size() > 1024) { return; }
}
// ...
```

- Judging from its usage illustrated above: which rule must be satisfied in
  the implementation of class `LogFileReader` (or one of its members)?
- Name a popular technique in resource management that depends on this rule,
  and briefly explain its principle.


# 2. Iterators

# 2.1 Algorithm Basics

The following algorithm dereferences and returns a given iterator's successor
unless the successor's referenced value matches some condition. The algorithm
is semantically correct but does not compile for iterators of some containers.

- Which containers? Briefly explain why the algorithm does not work for these
  and how it has to be changed.

```c++
template <typename Iterator, typename Value = typename Iterator::value_type>
Value next_value_or_default(Iterator it, Iterator end, Value default) {
  if (it == end || it+1 == end) { return default; }
  return it[1];
}
```

# 2.2 Container Wrapper

The STL's `std::vector` guarantess that its elements are stored in a
contiguous memory region and is therefore compatible to C-style arrays.
The member function `.data()` returns a pointer to the vector's underlying
raw memory.

For many hardware-tuning techniques, data is accessed in chunks.
Assuming a `std::vector<uint32_t>` and 64 bytes per cache line, for example,
vector elements could be loaded in chunks of 64/(32/8) = 16 elements.

-   Write a container wrapper
    
        cpppc::chunks<B, T, Container>
    
    that provides a sequential container interface on elements in `Container`
    in chunks of maximum size `B` bytes.

The template signature is derived from `std::stack`, a similar wrapper
type defined in the STL:

<http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/stack>

You only need to implement a minimal interface like constructors and
`begin()`, `end()`, however.

Example use case:

```c++
std::vector<uint16_t> v_us;

//                                    ,-- wrapped container
//                                    |
cpppc::chunks<128, uint16t_t, std::vector<uint16_t>> v_chunks(v_us);
//             |      |
//             |      '-- element type
//             |
//             '-- maximum size of a
//                 single chunk in bytes

// Iterate chunks:
auto first_chunk = v_chunks.begin();
auto chunk_size  = std::distance(v_chunks.begin(), v_chunks.end());
                   // --> 128/(16/8) = 64

// Iterators on elements in a chunk:
uint16_t first_chunk_elem = *first_chunk.begin();
uint16_t third_chunk_elem = first_chunk[2];

// Pointer to data in second chunk:
uint16_t chunk_1_data = v_chunks[1].data();
// Pointer to data in third chunk (= end pointer of data in second chunk):
uint16_t chunk_2_data = v_chunks[2].data();
```

Note that you need two iterator types:

- `cpppc::chunks<...>::iterator` for iterating chunks; it references
  `cpppc::chunks<...>::value_type` (= type of single chunks)
- and another iterator type to access chunk elements.

It might be best if you use existing STL containers like  `std::vector<T>`
or `std::array<T, ChunkSize>` as chunk type: these would already provide
the sequence container interface to chunk elements you need.

**Note**

The `cpppc::chunks` container adapter can (and should) be implemented as a
*view*, that is: without copying elements of the underlying vector.

## 2.X Bonus

If you want to implement more sophisticated type size calculations like alignment
requirements, refer to the C++ type support utilities:

<http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types>

Or make yourself familiar with the boost Align library (brace for impact):

<http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/doc/html/align.html>



# 3. Algorithms, Function Templates, Type Deduction

- Implement a function interface `void log10(X)` that accepts a numeric value of type `X`
  and:

    - prints the base 10 logarithm of the value if it is an integer
    - prints the base 10 logarithm of the value's square root if it is a floating point
      value

- Implement a function interface `void print_walk(T begin, T end)` that accepts a range
  of iterators of type `T` and prints all values in the range. In this, the iteration
  order depends on the iterator type:

    - for random-access iterators, tha order should be (pseudo) random but every element
      in the range must only be printed once
    - for input iterators, elements are printed in order from `begin` to `end-1`
    - for bidirectional iterators, elements are printed in reverse order from `end-1` to
      `begin`


# 4. Thread-Safety

## 4.1 Parallelism and STL Containers

Given the following operations on an instance of `std::vector`, consider
operations in the same table row to be executed by multiple threads in
parallel:

```c++
// Shared vector instance accessed by thread A and thread B:
std::vector<int> v;

// thread A:                    | thread B:
// =============================|==============================
   std::vector<int> a;          | std::vector<int> b;
// -----------------------------+------------------------------
   int xa = v[3];               | int xb = v[4];
// -----------------------------+------------------------------
   v[3] = 123;                  | v[4] = 345;
// -----------------------------+------------------------------
   v[3] = 123;                  | int xb = v[3];
// -----------------------------+------------------------------
   v.push_back(24);             | v.size();
// -----------------------------+------------------------------
   v.back();                    | v.push_back(54);
// -----------------------------+------------------------------
   v.begin();                   | v.push_back(34);
// -----------------------------+------------------------------
   v.back();                    | v.pop_back();
// -----------------------------+------------------------------
```

- For every pair of operation on the same table row, give a brief
  explanation on the guarantees with respect to thread-safety according to
  the C++ standard.

## 4.2 Producer-Consumer Problem

Simply put, one thread is producing goods and another thread is consuming goods.
We want the consumer thread to wait **using a condition variable**, and we want
`goods.push(i)` to be mutually exclusive to `goods.pop()`.

We are letting c++ and c-- be surrogates for this mutual exclusion, since we can
easily check if we correctly end up with 0 in the end.

Run the code as it is, and you will see that the net value is way off:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <mutex>
#include <chrono>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int c = 0;
    bool done = false;
    queue<int> goods;

    thread producer([&]() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 500; ++i) {
            goods.push(i);
            c++;
        }

        done = true;
    });

    thread consumer([&]() {
        while (!done) {
            while (!goods.empty()) {
                goods.pop();
                c--;
            }
        }
    });

    producer.join();
    consumer.join();
    cout << "Net: " << c << endl;
}
```
