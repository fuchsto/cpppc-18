## Universal Reference

In [lab session 5](/session-05/session-05), we learned declarations of `rvalue` references (actually: `xvalue`):

~~~c++
void wrapper(Foo && foo) {
   func(foo);
}
~~~

To tell whether you need `std::move` or not, just remember that it is equivalent to `static_cast<Foo &&>(foo)`. In this example, `foo` already is an `rvalue` reference so there is no need to `std::move`. It would not hurt but just have no effect.

Now I need you to relax and remember that high blood pressure leads to serious disease, so try not to get upset.

In the following example, parameters `rval_ref` and `univ_ref` do not have the same type category:

~~~c++
void wrapper_rval(Foo && rval_ref);

template <class T>
void wrapper_univ(T && univ_ref);
~~~

# Functional Programming in C++

Recommended talk: [Ivan Cukic: Functional reactive programming in C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2MmURgc6cU)

# Threads

Creating threads is easy:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
using namespace std;

void func(int x) {
    cout << "Inside thread " << x << endl;
}

int main() {
    thread th(&func, 100);
    th.join();
    cout << "Outside thread" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

# Race Conditions

Let us imagine that x * x is a very costly operation and we want to
calculate the sum
of squares up to a certain number.
It would make sense to parallelize the calulation of each square across
threads.

We can do something like this:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <thread>
using namespace std;

int accum = 0;

void square(int x) {
    accum += x * x;
}

int main() {
    vector<thread> ths;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
        ths.push_back(thread(&square, i));
    }

    for (auto& th : ths) {
        th.join();
    }
    cout << "accum = " << accum << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This should sum all squares up to and including 20. We iterate up to
20, and launch a new thread in each iteration that we give the
assignment to. After this, we call join() on all our threads, which
is a blocking operation that waits for the thread to finish, before
continuing the execution.

This is important to do before we print accum, since otherwise our
threads might not be done yet. You should always join your threads
before leaving main, if you haven't already.

Before moving on, also note that C++11 offers more terse iteration
syntax of the vector class, very close in syntax to Java.
We are also using the keyword auto instead of specifying the data
type thread, which we can do whenever the compiler can unambiguously
guess what the correct type should be. We added an & to retrieve a
reference and not a copy of the object, since join changes the nature
of the object.

Now, run this. Chances are it spits out 2870, which is the correct
answer.

Let's use our bash shell to run it a few more times (assuming you
compiled it to a.out):

$$
\text{for} \, (i \in \{1 \dots 40\} ; \quad \text{do} \quad \text{./a.out}; \quad \text{done}
$$

See any inconsistencies yet? Better yet, let's list all distinct outputs
from 1000
separate runs, including the count for each output:

$$
\text{for} \, (i \in \{1 \dots 1000\} ; \quad \text{do} \quad \text{./a.out}; \quad \text{done} \, | \, sort \, | \, uniq -c
$$

You should definitely see plenty of incorrect answers, even though most
of the time it gets it right. This is because of something called 
a race condition.
When the compiler processes accum += x * x;, reading the current value
of accum and setting the updated value is not an atomic (meaning
indivisible) event. Let's re-write square to capture this:

```c++
int temp = accum;
temp += x * x;
accum = temp;
Now, let's say the first two threads are interleaved over time, giving
us something like this:

// Thread 1             // Thread 2
int temp1 = accum;      int temp2 = accum;          // temp1 = temp2 = 0
                        temp2 += 2 * 2;             // temp2 = 4
temp1 += 1 * 1;                                     // temp1 = 1
                        accum = temp1;              // accum = 1
accum = temp2;                                      // accum = 4
```

We end up with accum as 4, instead of the correct 5.

Exercise:

Before we fix the race condition, since keeping accum as a global
variable is poor style, we would rather pass it into the thread.
Add a parameter `int& accum` to `square`. It is important that it's a
reference, since we want to be able to change the accumulator.
However, we can't simply call `thread(&square, accum, i)`, since it
will make a copy of accum and then call `square` with that copy.
To fix this, we wrap `accum` in `ref()`, making it
`thread(&square, ref(accum), i)`.


## Mutex

A mutex (mutual exlusion) allows us to encapsulate blocks of code that
should only be executed in one thread at a time. Keeping the main
function the same:

```c++
int accum = 0;
mutex accum_mutex;

void square(int x) {
    int temp = x * x;
    accum_mutex.lock();
    accum += temp;
    accum_mutex.unlock();
}
```

Try running the program repeatedly again and the problem should now be
fixed. The first thread that calls lock() gets the lock. During this
time, all other threads that call lock(), will simply halt, waiting at
that line for the mutex to be unlocked. It is important to introduce the
variable temp, since we want the x * x calculations to be outside the
lock-unlock block, otherwise we would be hogging the lock while we're
running our calculations.

## Atomic

C++11 offers even nicer abstractions to solve this problem. For
instance, the atomic
container:

```c++
#include <atomic>

atomic<int> accum(0);

void square(int x) {
    accum += x * x;
}
```

We don't need to introduce temp here, since x * x will be evaluated
before handed off to accum, so it will be outside the atomic event.

## Tasks

An even higher level of abstraction avoids the concept of threads
altogether and talks in terms of
tasks instead. Consider the following example:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <future>
#include <chrono>
using namespace std;

int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    auto a = async(&square, 10);
    int v = a.get();

    cout << "The thread returned " << v << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

The async construct uses an object pair called a promise and a future.
The former has made a promise to eventually provide a value. The future
is linked to the
promise and can at any time try to retrieve the value by get(). If the
promise hasn't
been fulfilled yet, it will simply wait until the value is ready. The
async hides most
of this for us, except that it returns in this case a future<int>
object. Again, since
the compiler knows what this call to async returns, we can use auto to
declare the future.

Exercise:

Use async to solve the sum of squares problem. Iterate up to 20 and add
your future<int>
objects to a vector<future<int>>. Then, finally iterate all your futures
and retrieve the
value and add it to your accumulator. This should be only a few
modifications from the
code above. 

## this\_thread

Let's make sure this really runs in parallel. Using the code from the
last exercise,
now add a cout that prints x inside square. Run your program again.
Every time you run
it, it should be listing the values of x in order. This seems awfully
deterministic and
is not characteristic of running things in parallel. We did start them
in that order, so
maybe the threads aren't overtaking each other. We can check this by
adding a sleep
inside square, which we can pretend is the heavy computation of x * x:

```c++
this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::milliseconds(100));
```

Note that all these seemingly global objects are in the std namespace,
but since we issued
using namespace std, we made them visible globally. Okay, run this and
time the execution.
They are clearly taking turns and they are not running in parallel. Use
cout to print `this_thread::get_id()`.

Since the main execution is also considered a thread, try printing the
thread ID inside
main using this same function. What does this tell you?

The function async by default gives the program the option of running it
asynchronously
or deferred. The latter means square will be called first when we call
get(), and it
will be executed in the same thread. Ideally, the program should make an
intelligent
decision, optimized for performance, but for some reason GCC always
defers, so let's not
give it a choice about it.

Change the call to async as follows:

```c++
async(launch::async, &square, ...)
```

Run it again, timing the execution.


**Note**

We got a 20 time speed up only because our threads aren't actually heavy
on the CPU while sleeping, so it's not an ideal surrogate for imagining
that x * x actually takes 100 ms of CPU time.
In the real case, the speed up would be largely determined by how many
cores we have on our computer.

Ideally, you should avoid starting more computationally intensive
threads than your computer can truly run in parallel, since otherwise
your CPU cores will start switching its attention
between different threads. Each switch is called a context switch and
comes with an overhead that will hurt performance.

## Condition Variables

If we return to threads, it would be useful to be able to have one
thread wait for another
thread to finish processing something, essentially sending a signal
between the threads.
This can be done with mutexes, but it would be awkward. It can also be
done using a global
boolean variable called notified that is set to true when we want to
send the signal.

The other thread would then run a for loop that checks if notified is
true and stops
looping when that happens. Since setting notified to true is atomic and
in this example
we're only setting it once, we don't even need a mutex. However, on the
receiving thread
we are running a for loop at full speed, wasting a lot of CPU time. We
could add a short
`sleep_for` inside the for loop, making the CPU idle most of the time.

A more principled way however is to add a call to wait for a condition
variable inside the for loop.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <mutex>
#include <chrono>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

condition_variable cond_var;
mutex m;

int main() {
    int value = 100;
    bool notified = false;
    thread reporter([&]() {
        /*
        unique_lock<mutex> lock(m);
        while (!notified) {
            cond_var.wait(lock);
        }
        */
        cout << "The value is " << value << endl;
    });

    thread assigner([&]() {
        value = 20;
        /*
        notified = true;
        cond_var.notify_one();
        */
    });

    reporter.join();
    assigner.join();
    return 0;
}
```

First of all, we're using some new syntax from C++11, that enables us to define the
thread functions in-place as anynomous functions. They are implicitly passed the local
scope, so they can read and write value and notified. If you compile it as it is, it
will output 100 most of the time. However, we want the reporter thread to wait for the
assigner thread to give it the value 20, before outputting it. You can do this by
uncommenting the two /* ... */ blocks in either thread function. In the assigner thread,
it will set notified to true and send a signal through the condition variable cond_var.
In the reporter thread, we're looping as long as notified is false, and in each
iteration we wait for a signal. Try running it, it should work.

But wait, if cond_var can send a signal that will make the call cond_var.wait(lock)
blocking until it receives it, why are we still using notified and a for loop? Well,
that's because the condition variable can be spuriously awaken even if we didn't call
notify_one, and in those cases we need to fall back to checking notified. This for loop
will iterate that many times.

This is a simplified description since we are also giving wait the object lock, which
is associated with a mutex m. What happens is that when wait is called, it not only
waits for a notification, but also for the mutex m to be unlocked. When this happens,
it will acquire the lock itself. If cond_var has acquired a lock and wait is called
again, it will be unlocked as long as it's waiting to acquire it again. This gives us
some structure of mutual exclusion between the two threads, as we will see in the
following example.


Don't expect the fix to be that trivial.
Just wrapping all access to the shared memory in lock-unlock blocks can fix this problem,
but remember that we don't want the consumer loop to run amok, taking up resources, so a
condition variable is ideal. Use the commands for executing the problem 1000 times to
test the integrity of your solution.
