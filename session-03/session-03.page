# From Pointer to Iterator

In the implementation of `vector` in assignment 2, pointers work nicely to
iterate vector elements. De-referencing a pointer to a vector element would
resolve the element's value.

In brief, vector iterators allow the following expressions that are valid
for any sequential container:

~~~c++
vector v;

vector_iterator b = v.begin();
vector_iterator e = v.end();

int v_size = e - b;

vector_iterator v_second = b + 1;
~~~




# Introduction to C++ Templates

## Class Templates

### Trivia: Class Templates in C

In the last assignment, the implementation of class `Vector` in C used `int`
as a fixed type of the vector elements.

To add a definition of a vector for elements of type `double`, the vector class
implementation has to be duplicated with all occurrences of `int` replaced by
`double`.

In C99, the only way to avoid duplicate code is to use a macro like this:

~~~c++
/**
 * Usage:
 *    DECLARE_GENERIC__VECTOR(ulong, unsigned long);
 * -> declares Vector_ulong
 */
#define DECLARE_GENERIC__VECTOR(QUAL_TYPE, VECTOR_VALUE_TYPE) \
  typedef VECTOR_VALUE_TYPE \
          Vector_##QUAL_TYPE##_Value;  \
  \
  typedef Vector_##QUAL_TYPE##_Value * \
          Vector_##QUAL_TYPE##_Iterator; \
  \
  typedef struct { \
    int                          size; \
    Vector_##QUAL_TYPE##_Value * data; \
  } Vector_##QUAL_TYPE; \

// ... and so on ...
~~~

Templates in C++ *in principle* realize the same mechanism. For some compiler
errors from templates, it helps to keep the code generation aspects in mind.

The overall procedure of template instantiation in C++ involes several stages of
symbolic (rather than lexical) operations, but you can refer to the macro-based
variant as a mental model.

But this is just mechanics.

Conceptually, templates are well-defined formal constructs and an essential part
of the C++ type system.

Templates should be considered as functions that return types.


### Class Templates in C++

In C++, the "code generation" of fully qualified types like `Vector_int` and
`Vector_float` from the C examples above is a built-in compiler function that is
accessible with the template syntax.

Example: 

~~~c++
template <typename T>
class Foo
{

public:

  void add(const T & value) {
    _vector.push_back(value);
  }

  // ...

private:

  Vector<T> _vector;

};
~~~

In the macro-variant above, `Vector` is not a usable type, as it is not fully
qualified.

It is, however, usable as a concept: all types created from the `Vector`
template have identical methods with identical semantics defined, independent from
the concrete element type.

The concrete definitions `Vector_int` and `Vector_float` are actual type names that
a programmer can use in code. To the compiler, a type `Vector` simply does not
exist.

For the same reason, `Foo` is not a type in the C++ example above, but
`Foo<int>` and `Foo<double>` are. You can think of the symbols `<` and `>` as
part of the type name just like they were "regular" characters like `_`.

If two classes are named `Foo_string` and `Foo_double`, you would expect that they have
separate implementations.

And in fact, the implementations of `Foo<int>` and `Foo<double>` might be totally
different just as well, just like functions `Foo(int)` and `Foo(double)` may have
specific implementations.


### Data Structure vs. Container Concept

The term **Data Structure** refers to the (internal) arrangement of data in
memory and the mechanisms that maintain this arrangement.

The term **Container** refers to the (public) operations and their semantics
visible to the user.

Example:

- A *Tree* is a *Data Structure* as it defines the arrangement and connections of
  data in memory
- A *Set* is a *Container* that could be based on a *Data Structure* like a tree

But a *Set* could also be based on a dynamic array or a list.

Changing the underlying data structure does not affect semantics of the container.
Of course, the underlying data structure typically affects the complexity of the
container's methods, but computational complexity has no effect on semantics.

This conceptual separation can be observed in the STL in many places:

- the class template `std::stack` is not a container, it is a container wrapper
  that provides adapter methods (push and pop, obviously); \
  the underlying data structure is specified as template parameter
- the C++ standard does not specify which data structure should be used to implement
  STL containers, it only gives recommendations and specifies constraints on
  computational complexity of operations on containers


# The Importance of new and delete

We discussed the definitions of *Allocation*, *Initialization* and *Instantiation*
in the last session.

In C, you used `malloc` and `free` to *allocate* memory, and called an initialization
function to fill the allocated memory range with meaningful values (see `vector__new`
in the last assignment). \
In C++, these function should be considered as non-existing. There is no valid reason
to use them, and various reasons not to.

In the last session, we soon came to the conclusion that allocation and initialization
should not be available as separate operations. To ensure that objects can only be
created in a well-defined state, they should only be available in conjunction as an *Instantiation* method.

The `new` operator in C++ allocates an object of a specified type on the heap and
initializes the object by calling a constructor.

Likewise, the `delete` operator first calls the object's destructor before deallocating
its memory.


# The Importance to avoid new and delete

The `new` and `delete` operations should never appear in application code.

There are many good and widely accepted reasons for this guideline that we will
discuss in upcoming sessions. For now, you only have to be aware of one reason:
Whenever a resource is acquired in an application, it must be released at some point.
Now, an armada of additional, non-trivial problems arise: ownership of the resource
must be well-defined, and the resource must not be released if its is still referenced
by some part of the program, and so on.

Luckily, the alternatives to `new` and `delete` are straight-forward and conveniently
apply to resource management in general, like file handles and mutex locks.


# Rule of Zero and RAII

If a class follows the Rule of Three (or Rule of Five, see upcoming session), its
underlying resource management is encapsulated such that instances of the class can
be used like POD (plain old data):

~~~c++
if (condition) {
  // vector instance on stack, vector elements are internally
  // allocated on heap
  std::vector<int> v({ 100, 200, 300 });
  v.push_back(400);
  std::cout << "vector accumulate: "
            << std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0)
            << std::endl;
  // vector instance removed from stack, destructor of std::vector
  // deallocates elements from heap
}
~~~


## Must-know: realloc in C++

It is worth mentioning that `malloc/free` and `new/delete` are incompatible mechanisms:
memory allocated with `malloc` cannot be deallocated using `delete` and calling
`free` on memory reserved with `new` yields undefined behavior.

Luckily you don't have to care as you won't use either of them.

But what about `realloc`? What is the equivalent operation in C++?

It's simple: **Use `std::vector`**. \
It provides the best optimized, all-purpose RAII-encapsulation of dynamic memory
managment and it is nearly impossible to break.

For the same reason you also should avoid `new/delete` and use `std::vector` instead 
whenever you can.

Consider this example:

~~~c++
if (foo != 0) {
  std::vector<double> buf(50); // ~> malloc(50 * sizeof(double));
  buf.resize(60);              // ~> realloc(buf, 60 * sizeof(double));
  buf.push_back(12.23);        // ~> int buf_write_index = 0;
                               //    buf[buf_write_index] = 12.23;
                               //    buf_write_index++;
  throw std::runtime_error("What now?");
  // vector `buf` is removed from stack and its destructor
  // is called, no memory leak!
  // If we used an explicit `free` or `delete`, it would not
  // be reached:
                               // ~> free(buf); // not called if exception
                                                // is thrown before
}

# Debugging

## gdb

### Installation

Install gdb on the VM:

~~~bash
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gdb
# Confirm with <ENTER>
~~~

### Example

Using test suite as an example for debugging with gdb:

~~~bash
$ gdb ./testsuite.bin
~~~

This starts program `testsuite.bin` and halts execution at its entry point (usually the
`main` function entry point).


First, let's switch to a more useful view. In gdb, enter `<CTRL-X> 2`.
This switches to a TUI (terminal user interface, a GUI in the terminal) consisting of
three view sections: the source code at the top with assembly below, and the gdb command
line at the bottom.

Or, write the content of
[this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit/master/gdbinit)
to `~/.gdbinit` for colored output and overall prettier gdb (incompatible with TUI
apparently).

Searching for gdb dotfiles on github gives lots of other coder's gdb tweaks like
[this one](https://github.com/RAttab/dotfiles/blob/master).

Now, enable pretty printing for displaying values:

~~~gdb
(gdb) set print pretty on
~~~

You will find the integrated help system of gdb very useful:

~~~gdb
(gdb) help
# display help for a command category like "running":
(gdb) help running
# display help for a specific command:
(gdb) help next
~~~

To debug a specific function like `vector__push_back`, add a break point at the 
function's entry point using the gdb command `break`.

You can use auto-completion to choose from all functions named 'vector__' like:

~~~gdb
(gdb) break vector__<TAB><TAB> (select a function name) <ENTER>
~~~

To run the program, use the gdb command `run`. Execution will halt at the first break
point.

~~~gdb
(gdb) run
~~~

To continue execution in single operations step-by-step, use `next` or `n`:

~~~gdb
(gdb) n
~~~

To repeat the last command, just hit `<ENTER>`.

Show the value of a variable with `print` (ensure that pretty-printing is enabled as
described above):

~~~gdb
(gdb) print *data
~~~

## valgrind

Install valgrind on the VM:

~~~bash
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install valgrind
# Confirm with <ENTER>
~~~

From the [valgrind quick start tutorial](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html):

Example program:

~~~c
  #include <stdlib.h>

  void f(void)
  {
     int* x = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
     x[10] = 0;        // problem 1: heap block overrun
  }                    // problem 2: memory leak -- x not freed

  int main(void)
  {
     f();
     return 0;
  }
~~~

Using valgrind to check for memory leaks:

~~~bash
$ valgrind --leak-check=yes myprog [arg1 arg2 ...]
~~~

Output from memory check:

~~~
  ==19182== Invalid write of size 4
  ==19182==    at 0x804838F: f (example.c:6)
  ==19182==    by 0x80483AB: main (example.c:11)
  ==19182==  Address 0x1BA45050 is 0 bytes after a block of size 40 alloc'd
  ==19182==    at 0x1B8FF5CD: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:130)
  ==19182==    by 0x8048385: f (example.c:5)
  ==19182==    by 0x80483AB: main (example.c:11)
~~~
