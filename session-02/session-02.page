# Of Types, States and Concepts

The C-style representation of strings is notoriously error-prone and causes security
incidents on a daily basis. The fundamental problem with C-strings is their lack of
a well-defined type specification.

Briefly, yet formally put: when a function receives a value of C-string type, it
cannot rely on any semantics that restrict the value to a well-defined state.

If this sounds confusing, consider this example: 

~~~c
char * stringish; // <- used as string type by convention (not by definition!)
~~~

The variable `stringish` could denote a pointer to a single character or the start
address of a dynamically allocated memory range.

Functions like `strlen` in the C standard library expect a string by convention.
That is to say: there is an informal aggreement between the implementer of the
function and the programmer calling it that only strings will be passed to this function.
Should the programmer pass a pointer to a single character, neither the compiler
nor the runtime can prevent the execution.

This code would compile flawlessly and run perfectly fine until the unevitable
segmentation / access violation fault:

~~~c
char * not_a_string    = (char *)(123);        // Oh boy, the C-style cast ...
int i_will_never_exist = strlen(not_a_string); // *sigh*
~~~

So at this point, `stringish` has been `declared` but not `defined` yet, as no
value has been assigned. A *well-defined state* of a C-string variable must contain an 
address of the start address of an memory range allocated for a string:

~~~c
stringish = (char *)malloc(nchars);
~~~

Now, the C-string referenced by `stringish` is *allocated*, but not initialized.
Passing it to `strlen` would still fail, as a *well-defined state* of a C-string is
null-terminated: a string of length `n` must occupy a memory range of `n+1` characters
as a `'\0'` must be assigned after the last character in the string to denote the end
of the string (see `man 3 strlen`).

~~~c
stringish[nchars-1] = '\0';
~~~

Only now is `stringish` a well-defined state of a C-string.
It still contains nonsensical values no character sequence has been written into
allocated memory, but it can be safely used in any operation expecting a string.

*Exactly this is the definition of a well-defined state*.

    The state of an object is valid if all operations defined for its type can be
    executed on the object without breaking the operation semantics.


In conclusion, there are three steps to achieve a valid state of an object:

1. Declaration
2. Allocation
3. Definition (= Initialization)

In C, these steps are not coupled and it is in the programmer's the responsibility
to specify them correctly. Compilers got better at detecting "code smells", but
compiler warnings - if created on a Turing machine - will never help in non-trivial
cases for well-known reasons.



## The Tao of Concepts

A practicable solution to this is the definition of types as a unseperable
coupling of *operations* and *states*.
In C++, a **category of types** that satisfy common semantics is called `concept`,
an essential term with specific connotation in C++.
A concept definition consists of:


Valid Expressions
: A set of syntactically defined interactions that have common behaviour for any
  type of this concept, for example `(a+b)` for numerals

Semantics
: Pre-conditions, invariants and post-conditions of these expressions with respect
  to objects (= states) of the type 

Dependent Types
: Types provided by a base type that are visible to the user;
  A list container, for example, must provide a dependent type like `element_type`
  as the programmer needs a way to determine the type of values returned by
  operations like `head(list)`


Note that there is no mention of "interface" (in the Java sense), "methods" or
"class members". Concepts are not about function signatures as you know them
from API documentations. Signatures are a technical necessity, not a formal
description.

When reasoning about C++ concepts, you should tune your mind set to the fundamentals
of category theory. This sounds like obscenely acamedic formalese, but have a
second look at the first paragraph in this section.

For example, the concrete types `list` and `array` are equivalent in several
aspects but also exhibit peculiar differences.



# A String Class in C

Enough with the formal boilerplate: what does *coupling states and operations in
type definitions* actually mean in code?

Considering the string example above, we learned that the three steps towards a
valid state of a string should be combined in a single operation.

In C++, such "unified" operations are constructors. They make it already
*syntactically* impossible to create an object with an invalid state.

We can't achieve this ideal in C because its type system is too weak, so we still
have to resort to convention. But we can specify types that satisfy well-defined
concepts.

In the listing below, the type `String` is defined as

- A set of properties that specify the string's state, represented as a struct;
  in the object-oriented sense, an object of this struct type are string *instances*

- Functions that accept instances of `String` and modify its state, better known as
  `methods` in the object-oriented model

So, what makes a function a method? The term `method` refers to the following crucial
criterion:

    A method is a function that implements an operation on an object of a specific
    type that transfers the object from one well-defined state to another.

This definition describes the following conditions:

Pre-Condition
: Before invoking the method, the object is in a valid state

Post-Condition
: After executing the method's operation, the object is in a valid state

This also implies the following:

Invariant
: If an object is in a valid state, invoking any method defined for the object's
  type results in a semantically correct execution of the method.

Now, **finally**, let's see how the *Rule of Three* for a `String` class could be
implemented in C:

~~~c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>


typedef struct {
  char  * data;
  char    size;
} String;

String * string_new() {
   String * target = (String *)(malloc(sizeof(String));
   target->data = NULL;
   target->size = 0;
   return target;
}

String * string_assign(String * lhs, String * rhs) {
  if (lhs->size != rhs->size) {
    lhs->size = rhs->size;
    lhs->data = realloc(lhs->data, lhs->size);
  }
  strcpy(target->data, str);
  return lhs;
}

String * string_copy(const String * other) {
  // see why well-defined methods are useful?
  String * target = string_new();
  string_assign(target, other);
  return target;
}

void     string_delete(String * str) {
  free(str->data);
  free(str);
}
~~~


# Type Qualifiers, References vs. Pointers

[This documented code listing](/session-02/01-references/Cxx_DeclType_References.cc)
contains the findings discussed in the lab session. This section gives a brief summary.


Anatomy of an assignment by example:

~~~c++
  //     left-hand side       right-hand side
  //            |                    |
  //  .---------'---------.     .----'---.
       const Type * lvalue   =   & rvalue
  //   |     |    | |            | |
  //   |     |    | '- named     | '- named or unnamed
  //   |     |    |              |
  //   |     |    '- type        '- operator
  //   |     |
  //   |     '- referenced type
  //   |
  //   '- cvr
~~~

CVR is short for the qualifier category "const, volatile, restrict".

~~~c++
  int value = 100;
~~~

This is the *declaration* of variable p_value. \
On the left hand side *of a declaration*, `*` refers to a type:

~~~c++
  int * p_value;
~~~

This is a *definition* of variable p_value. \
On the right hand side, & is an operator:

~~~c++
  p_value = &value;
~~~

On the left hand side *of an assignment* `*` is the dereference operator:

~~~c++
  *p_value = 222;
~~~

You actually can't mix this up (more important, neither can the compiler)
as `*` is not a complete type:

~~~c++
  int * inst = NULL; // declaration/definition, int * is complete type
      * inst = NULL; // assignment of value referenced by pointer
~~~

Pointer values have no restriction whatsoever. Therefore, they cannot be trusted:

~~~c++
  p_value = NULL;
  p_value = (int*)(123); // <-- may I introduce you to the
                         //     horrible, horrible C-style cast?
~~~

On the right hand size, `*` is an operator ...

~~~c++
  int  deref   = *p_value;
~~~

... except when used within type specifiers like casts, of course:

~~~c++
  long deref_l = *((long *)p_value);
  //             ^       ^
  //             |       |
  //             |       '- type specifier, casting to "pointer-to-long*
  //             '- dereference operator
~~~

On the left hand side, `&` denotes a reference type.
References must be initialized (= defined) with their declaration.
Think of references as 'variable aliases'.
They are always named and can only refer to another named value.

~~~c++
  int & ref = my_variable;
~~~

For a mental model, you can consider references as quantum-entangled.

~~~c++
  ref = 123;
  assert(value == 123);

  int & one = 1; // <-- nope, `1` is not named
  one = 2;       // <-- you see the problem?
~~~

Variables `ref` and `value` are *identical*.
In C/C++, two variables are *identical* if they represent the same
address:

~~~c++
  assert(&ref == &value);
~~~

*Equality* refers to the *values* of variables. Obviously, identity implies equality.

~~~c++
  int a, b;
  a = 12;
  b = 12; // a equals b
~~~

In C++ lingo, *named* values are usually called "lvalues", because
they can be used at the left hand side of an assignment.
*Unnamed* values are called "rvalues" because they can only be used at
the right hand side of an assignment.

For example, `123` is an rvalue because a statement like:

~~~c++
123 = variable;
~~~

... would be nonsensical.
